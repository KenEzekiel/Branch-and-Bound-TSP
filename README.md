## Project Description

This project is a Branch and Bound Algorithm implementation project for solving the TSP Problem, assigned as a bonus task for the Algorithm and Strategies Course. Given a graph representation as adjacency matrix, using the reduced cost matrix approach. Made by Kenneth Ezekiel 13521089, Bandung Institute of Technology.

The constraint in this implementation is that the adjacency matrix must contain all values (all nodes must be connected to every other node). This project is also made using Ruby.

## Running The Program

1. Make sure to have ruby installed
2. Open the root directory of this project in the terminal
3. Run the program using `ruby src/tsp.rb`
4. The program will ask for an input file name, which can be inserted into the `test` directory in the form of a `.txt` file

## Project Dependencies

`Ruby 3.1` - Installed from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
